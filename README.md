# Infra CI Pipeline

This repository is a small repo which contains code to demonstrate a CI pipline for infrastructure delivery of
Virtual Machine templates to be used by consumers.

There is a corresponding blog post detailing how to set up/configure a complete CI pipeline which utilizes this
repository and can be found [here](https://jekhokie.github.io/ci/cd/jenkins/virtualbox/vm/infrastructure/docker/ansible/2019/05/14/infrastructure-ci-pipeline.html).
